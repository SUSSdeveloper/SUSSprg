### Overview
Welcome to SUSS (Speeding Up Slow Start), an open-source project aimed at tackling the issue of bandwidth under-utilization during the TCP slow-start phase. Our lightweight sender-side add-on, compatible with CUBIC [1] and implemented in Linux kernel 5.19.10, focuses on reducing flow completion time (FCT), a vital performance metric for the Internet end-users [2].
With SUSS, users simply need to apply the changes to the Linux kernel's source code and recompile it for seamless integration. This README includes an installation roadmap and excerpts from a more comprehensive academic paper that delve into detailed information about SUSS, covering its theory and performance analysis. For the full in-depth analysis, please refer to the academic paper available at [will_be_published](http://will_be_published/).
We value community contributions and will share the contributing guidelines shortly. Join us in optimizing TCP connections for faster, more efficient data transfer.


### List of Modifications in the Linux Source Code
SUSS introduces multiple modifications to the Linux TCP source code. <b>We also added lines of code for logging and performance tracking, which can be removed in the final product.</b> The original Linux files can be found in the `sourceCode/linux-VER/orig` directory, while the altered versions are stored in the `sourceCode/linux-VER/suss` directory within the project.
These changes are as follows:

- a) In the file `tcp.h`, SUSS defines a set of global variables within the `struct tcp_sock`.
- b) The slow-start mechanism of CUBIC has been altered by SUSS in the file `tcp_cubic.c`.
- c) SUSS has made a small modification to the file `tcp_output.c` to enable data transmission during the pacing period.
- d) In the file `tcp_input.c`, which deals with incoming acknowledgments (ACKs), SUSS adds a few lines of code.
- e) To assign a random ID for each test, a few lines of code have been added to the file `tcp_cong.c`.

You can identify SUSS's specific modifications in the Linux source code by searching for the "/* suss" comments in the files located in the `sourceCode/linux-VER/suss` directory.


### Installation Roadmap
SUSS is currently implemented in Linux kernel 5.19.10 and 6.8.4. We recomend using a Debian-based Linux distribution like Ubuntu.
The simple installation process involves the following steps:
1. Prepare a Linux server. We recommend Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS; you can download the ISO file from [here](https://ubuntu.com/download/server/thank-you?version=24.04&architecture=amd64&lts=true).

2. Update the local package index and Install necessary build tools:
   <pre>
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y build-essential  libncurses-dev  libssl-dev  make  gcc  gawk  flex  bison  openssl  dkms libelf-dev libudev-dev libpci-dev libiberty-dev autoconf  llvm zstd dwarves
   </pre>

3. Install the Linux source package from the repository, then navigate to the source directory and extract the files.
   <pre>
   sudo apt-get install linux-source-6.8.0
   cd /usr/src
   sudo tar -xvf linux-source-6.8.0.tar.bz2
   </pre>

4. Copy the current kernel configuration file from the boot directory to the extracted directory, renaming it as `.config'. This step ensures that the existing kernel settings are preserved and used as a baseline for further configuration. 
   <pre>
   cd /usr/src/linux-source-6.8.0/
   sudo cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config
   sudo make oldconfig
   </pre>

5. Open the `.config` file with a text editor and find keys of CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS and CONFIG_SYSTEM_REVOCATION_KEYS and empty their values.


6. Prior to compiling the kernel, download the `sourceCode' directory from the project and replace the corresponding files with the modified ones. In this example, run:
   <pre>
   sudo cp  sourceCode/linux-6.8/suss/tcp_cubic.c   /usr/src/linux-source-6.8.0/net/ipv4/tcp_cubic.c
   sudo cp  sourceCode/linux-6.8/suss/tcp_input.c   /usr/src/linux-source-6.8.0/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c
   sudo cp  sourceCode/linux-6.8/suss/tcp_output.c  /usr/src/linux-source-6.8.0/net/ipv4/tcp_output.c
   sudo cp  sourceCode/linux-6.8/suss/tcp_cong.c    /usr/src/linux-source-6.8.0/net/ipv4/tcp_cong.c
   sudo cp  sourceCode/linux-6.8/suss/tcp.h         /usr/src/linux-source-6.8.0/include/linux/tcp.h
   </pre>
      
7. Compile the kernel:
   <pre>
   sudo make -j $(nproc)
   </pre>
   <br>The compilation process may take some time, depending on your system's hardware.

8. After successful compilation, install the new kernel using:
   <pre>
   sudo make modules_install -j $(nproc)
   sudo make install
   </pre>
   <br>This will install the kernel image, kernel modules, and update the bootloader configuration.

9. Update GRUB Configuration:
   <pre>
   sudo update-grub
   </pre>

10. After the installation and GRUB configuration update, reboot your system to use the newly compiled kernel:
   <pre>
   sudo reboot
   </pre>

11. To verify a successful installation, confirm that `suss' appears in the output of:
   <pre>
   ls /sys/module/tcp_cubic/parameters
   </pre>
Please note that the value of the module parameter `suss' indicates whether SUSS is enabled (1) or disabled (0).
